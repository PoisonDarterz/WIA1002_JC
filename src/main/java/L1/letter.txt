 My name is Jonas Chuan with matrix number, S2191660. I am 
majoring in CS (Information Systems). This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling rather excited about taking this 
subject. This is because there is alot of (completely) new things to learn finally after learning the same basics for ~3 years. 
I acquired A+ for my previous Fundamentals of Programming course. So, I 
think I can manage to get A/A+ for DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will put in some effort learning the new stuff due. Wish me luck!!!
